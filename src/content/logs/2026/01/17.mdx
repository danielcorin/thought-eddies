> Internal adoption charts have been vertical: ~30% of all pull requests merged to our frontend and backend repos are written by Inspect. It only took a couple months for us to reach this level of usage, and it continues to grow. We didn't force anyone to use Inspect over their own tools. We built to people's needs, created virality loops through letting it work in public spaces, and let the product do the talking.

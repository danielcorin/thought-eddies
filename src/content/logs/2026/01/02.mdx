I've been playing around with using Voice Activity Detection to record multiple separate audio channels, then stitching those together into a transcript with Whisper to do speech to text.

Agents make ideas so malleable.
A well articulated idea, or implementation of that idea is in invaluable yet almost completely fungible.
If someone explains an idea in detail, an agent can fluently apply it in any context you'd like.
Producing an artifact with this level of clarity is difficult, but once produced, it can be absorbed and applied broadly nearly instantly by anyone who learns of its existence.

I've been trying to reproduce a reference implementation of [Strix](https://timkellogg.me/blog/2025/12/15/strix).
In doing so, I am steering Claude Code to read the blog post and then setting up a personal version in my own environment.
That is works continues to floor me.

Tim's blog post is a sort of genetic code for Strix and when given access to this code, an agent can create another approximate digital incarnation of Strix, based on how Tim has written about it.
In the same way ideas could spread rapidly with the invention of the internet, now fully embodied concepts of functioning software can permeate throughout the internet if they are loosely described and defined in words.
The more detailed, the more faithful the implementation will be to the original.

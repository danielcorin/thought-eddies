I'm working through my second implementation of an idea that has been bouncing around my head for a while.
The general idea is to be able to transcribe a conversation in real time and have an agent read the transcription, turn it into a spec, and then build what is being discussed.
The ongoing conversation will steer the agent's work in real time.

I'm not sure if the agent will be fast enough for this to work well but we'll see how it goes.

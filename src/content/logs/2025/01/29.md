I spent some time building an iOS app today, all with Cursor.
I've never really written Swift before (well apparently I tried it [a year ago]({{< ref "logs/2024/01/07.md" >}})).
Since this was pre-Sonnet, I probably wasn't doing a ton of code generation at the time.
It will be interesting to see how far I can get.

I worked through a bit of setup to mount an R2 bucket to the local filesystem with `rclone` but haven't taken the final step to modify my system security permissions yet.

I one-shotted a simple post recommendation section for this site with Sonnet/Cursor.

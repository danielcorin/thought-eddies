I spent some time looking for low latency, image-to-image APIs.
I look around a fair bit and think I've settled on [together.ai](https://www.together.ai/).

My main needs are very similar to [Krea](https://www.krea.ai/)

- < 1 sec latency
- ability to specify the starting a prompt _and_ image

I'm still validating this is the case but latency seems nearly there and I'm still trying to confirm how to make a start image work.

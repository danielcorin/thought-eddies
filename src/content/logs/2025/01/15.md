I've been playing around a bunch with image generation models/tools, notably [Recraft](https://www.recraft.ai) and [Krea](https://www.krea.ai).
Recently, I've been trying to use these tools to design a logo and favicon for [Thought Eddies](https://www.thoughteddies.com).

I've also been experimenting with using D3 to build visuals for LLM chat conversation branching.
It's harder to work with than [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/), unsurprisingly since it is a much more general tool/framework.
I am aiming to create a few different interactive visuals to showcase a few different ideas I have for working with LLMs on a canvas.
Maybe I will end up going back to React Flow if I keep having challenges with D3.

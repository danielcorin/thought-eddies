I mostly browse social media apps like LinkedIn and Bluesky on my phone.
Recently, LinkedIn started surfacing a popup prompting me to download the app after a bit of scrolling the browser.
This prompts me to close LinkedIn entirely.
I'm curious if my behavior is unusual, or if they're getting enough conversions to app downloads for it to be worth it.
It's certainly caused me to use LinkedIn less which I am guessing is not the point.

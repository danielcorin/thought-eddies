OpenAI shipped a new version of 4o that can generate images.
I tried generating images in ChatGPT and it popped open a side chat and edit tool I hadn't seen before.
I got rate limited before I could try much.

I read [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.18600) on using "chain of draft", a more compressed version of chain of thought to achieve similar results to chain of thought reasoning.
The main unlock with this approach is a reduction in inference latency and cost due to few tokens needed to achieve similar performance.

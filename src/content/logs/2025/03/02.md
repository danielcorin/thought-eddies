I found an interesting library for building 3D games specifically "built for Cursor" called [`viber3d`](https://github.com/instructa/viber3d/).
I assume the name is a reference to "vibe coding".
This is the first library I have seen ship a starter scaffold [with Cursor rules](https://github.com/instructa/viber3d/tree/main/packages/viber3d-starter/.cursor/rules).
This is an interesting development in how frameworks are being built now.
Since language models don't know about brand new frameworks, frameworks are shipping with content that will aid language models in using them, since coding with models seems to be an increasingly popular way to code.

Hopefully, approaches like this can be part of how we prevent [AI from stifling tech adoption](https://vale.rocks/posts/ai-is-stifling-tech-adoption).

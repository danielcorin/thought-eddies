It's been a little while since I worked at all on [Delta](https://github.com/danielcorin/delta) but I still have the itch to have access to the source of the tool that becomes my daily LLM driver.
I recently setup [Chorus](https://chorus.sh/) which advertises itself as a tool to chat with multiple models at once.
This isn't really a main use case for me but besides not being open source, it's basically everything I want.

- Clean interface
- Text streaming
- Use my own API keys
- Local model support (ollama, LM Studio)
- Broad model API support
- Mini-mode triggered by a hotkey
- Conversation history
- Image support

I don't love that their cloud is involved with the service.
I understand this is required for them to make money but I can't see myself using a cloud product for this in the long term, especially for sending images of my system.
I feel like there is too much potential for things to go wrong.

Nevertheless, this is great work in my opinion.

Apparently, I've opened up pandora's box.
There are _so many_ tool like this with a variety of feature sets and tons of overlap.
I'll need to wade through and see what I can find.

I think I may need to build this for myself.

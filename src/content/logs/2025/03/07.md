I feel like `.cursorrules` are finally starting to snap into place for me.
I've made many messes in Cursor, but once I exhaust what is possible without structure, if I want to continue, I need to create a structure.
There's nothing like a painful refactor to reinforce how and why you should define conventions for your codebase.
Usually, when diving into a new idea, I don't love to think about this stuff, but it's always time well spent.
With this in mind, my plan is to try and build rules and structure as I go rather than pushing my projects to the limit then needing to clean up.

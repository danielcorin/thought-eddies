I made another attempt at using Claude Code to build an LLM-based DJ app, integrated with Spotify.
I figure this time, I would use a TUI (like Claude Code and Gemini CLI use) because I hoped it would be more testable.
Agent coding tools seem to get much further when they can write tests for themselves.

I am working on a macOS app, built in Swift and called Hudson.
I've been inspired by the UX of [Chorus](https://chorus.sh/) and the simplicity of [Ollamac](https://github.com/kevinhermawan/Ollamac).
My goal is to build an app that allows me to quickly send prompts to API or local LLMs.
I have most of the core functionality working.
What's next is to build something like Chorus' ambient chat UI.

Having an LLM prompt available via a global hotkey across any model and where my conversation history is stored locally feels like it will address several of my needs.
It's not that a similar app doesn't exist, it's that I know I will want to tweak the UX exactly to my liking.
With LLMs being so good at generating code, this is now a project that will take a week or two rather than a month or two.

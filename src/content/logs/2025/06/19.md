Been getting back to writing more after a period where I was very focused on building.
I missed it and feel like I have a bunch of ideas floating around that I want to write about.

I upgraded Hugo today.
It was mostly painless.
Apparently, the `--verbose` flag was removed and the Twitter shortcode was renamed to X.
I had to change my deploy script as a result of the former.

I also added the very nice [hugo-admonitions](https://github.com/KKKZOZ/hugo-admonitions) project to this site.

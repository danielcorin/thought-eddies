Today I learned the quote

> The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do

which is typically attributed to Steve Jobs was likely written by advertising copywriters at TBWA\Chiat\Day (the agency that created the campaign) rather than by Jobs himself[^1].

There were a ton of Cursor issues today.
I also saw 429s all day on Bedrock in us-west-2.

I know Cursor just launched their 1.0 and I also heard Anthropic cut Windsurf's access to Claude models and forced them to scramble to get Claude capacity via 3rd parties.

I wonder if Cursor's _and_ AWS's problems were the thundering herd of developers coming to them after Anthropic cutoff and Windsurf's access post-OpenAI acquisition.

And as I write these words, I just received an email at 6pm PT from Cursor about their 1.0 launch.

Not exactly hype if you are burying the launch email at dinner on a Friday.


This is all speculation -- I have no inside information.

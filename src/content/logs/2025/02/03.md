After more thinking than I really expected I would do about such a thing, I open-sourced [Delta](https://github.com/danielcorin/delta) today.
I still really like the concept of conversation branching for ideation, thought partnership and rabbit holing with LLMs.
There are several folks who are working on closed-source, cloud-hosted versions of similar ideas.
I don't have the bandwidth to pursue the project further right now, but if I can empower someone with the time and interest, that would be a win.

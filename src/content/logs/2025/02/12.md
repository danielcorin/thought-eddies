I've been doing a lot of [vibe coding](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383) lately (though I only recently learned there was a term for this).
My most recent projects include a Krea-like image editor.
I am currently working on adding inpainting using a mask and prompt.
I am also developing a tool that captures raw thoughts and processes them through an LLM, following some structure to summarize, deduplicate and consolidate.
The general goal is to synthesize and organize ideas for a project, article, or just to help with understanding where my ideas are leading.

Two, random interesting learnings from [Julia's survey results](https://jvns.ca/terminal-survey/results-bsky):

## The first

<kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>l</kbd> clears the terminal.
I used to rely on <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>k</kbd> for this but when using the embedded terminal in Cursor, it opens a completion panel so I had been briefly stuck typing `clear`.

## The second

```sh
history 0
```

which gets the all time shell command history.
This is useful for `history 0 | grep <query>`.
I use `fzf` and <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>r</kbd> to search through the history typically but this is still nice to know.
This had be an edge case I never quite resolved in my switch to zsh.
I was used to getting full history in bash with `history`.

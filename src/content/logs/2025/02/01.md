I've been working on and off on a very simple, Krea-inspired image editor in the browser that can turn sketches into images using Flux Canny.
I've tried a few separate times to prompt models (Sonnet, o1, r1) to add an undo-redo stack to my project.
All have failed.
It's possible I am under specifying the ask but interesting to identify this as a particular area where models don't seem to do very well.

I've continued pursing building this feature with a model more out of interest at this point, since I don't _really_ need it.
It provides a good test for new models when they are released (or maybe my code is irreparably broken).
I don't have desire to debug the problem so maybe I'll find out another time.

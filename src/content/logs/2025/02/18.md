A [great read](https://harper.blog/2025/02/16/my-llm-codegen-workflow-atm/) by Harper about writing code with LLMs.

One passage that particularly resonated with me

> When I describe this process to people I say “you have to aggressively keep track of what’s going on because you can easily get ahead of yourself.”
>
> For some reason I say “over my skies” a lot when talking about LLMs. I don’t know why. It resonates with me. Maybe it’s because it is beautiful smooth powder skiing, and then all of a sudden you are like “WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON!,” and are completely lost and suddenly fall off a cliff.

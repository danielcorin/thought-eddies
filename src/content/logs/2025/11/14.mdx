I've fallen behind on blog things.
In the past few weeks, I've been

- experimenting with [`claude-agent-sdk`](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python), equipping the agent with MCP and prompting to use a CLI measure trade-offs and ergonomics
- using humanlayer's RPI (research, plan, implement) [commands](https://github.com/humanlayer/humanlayer/blob/main/.claude/commands/research_codebase.md) on large codebases to implement complex features
- experimenting with sprites and tile sets for a game idea

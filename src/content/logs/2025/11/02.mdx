I've been experimenting using Claude Code to learn Rust.

Like learning to write it myself, not just build stuff in it with Claude Code.
I'm still unsure what level of abstraction learning programming is at now.

I've found, if you're familiar with building software, you can often be pretty serviceable in a language you don't know aided by an agent.
But different languages help you learn to think differently about the types of problems you encounter when building software.

I also want to know if and how I can use Claude Code explicitly for the purposes of learning something new.

My general structure was to prompt the goal of learning Rust, then ask for a plan that covers increasingly advanced topics in Rust.
Then, given this plan and "unit" structure, I prompted for koan-like exercises and a small project for each unit.

Claude Code really wanted to do all the work for me, but with some nudging, I've been able to get it to create the scaffolding for me to learn and then practice.
After making these improvements, I had the agent re-write the plan to incorporate the new approaches.

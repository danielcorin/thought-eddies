I built a Claude Code slash command that given a prompt, analyzes the ongoing chat and captures to insight or learning from the conversations.
This seems like it's going to be useful for capturing and searching a domain-specific knowledge base using queries that come to mind when I remember I did "that one thing a few months ago".

I'm planning to start this as a personal experiment but also see if I can incorporate it codebases with Claude Code commands and agents.

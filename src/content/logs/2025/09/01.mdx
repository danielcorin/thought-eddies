An interesting learning about the iOS Clock alarm app's time picker.
It [turns out](https://old.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/1n5lztw/the_time_picker_on_the_iphones_alarm_app_isnt/) it's a long list rather than a circular buffer.
Scrolling to the bottom of all three picker lists positions the time at 4:39pm.

I'm working on a macOS app that I use daily.
However, I also to development on it pretty much daily.
It requires several macOS permissions.
However, I was running into issues where the app had the same name but couldn't share permissions.
To switch between the two, I had to remove and re-add the permissions.

I gave Claude Sonnet 4 my problem and it walked my through to a solution without a hitch.
I gave it screenshots as I made progress and it gave me the next steps or considerations to make if there were several possible paths forward.

Now my Xcode build and production builds of the app can share the same permission and everything works smoothly.

This took maybe 20 minutes.
I'm very happy with the results.

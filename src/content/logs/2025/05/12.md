I built a RSS/JSON feed on top of Apple Notes.
I thought it would be a convenient way to programmatically read and create actions based off the content in Notes.
I think the Python wrapper on top of AppleScript that I was using ended up being a bit too slow for this to be practical.
It was taking ~19s to load a feed of ~70 notes.

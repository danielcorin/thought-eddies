Experimenting with the useful [sqlite-vector](https://github.com/sqliteai/sqlite-vector) library for managing vector embeddings in SQLite.
Also wrote up a [Datasette plugin](https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/writing_plugins.html) to query the embeddings in the [Datasette tool](https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/).

This seems to be faster and easier than I last attempted this a year and a half ago with [sqlite-vss](/til/sqlite/sqlite-vss).

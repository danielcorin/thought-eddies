I downgraded Claude Code to standard usage a little while ago and I have to say it's one of the best things I've done recently.
Not to say that I think Claude Code is excellent and effective - it is - but when I (occasionally) max out my Claude Code quota, I'm motivated to try a different agent coding tool.

Today, I did more work with `codex` than I've attempted in a while and found it to be quite effective and enjoyable.

I'm not sure if they originated this pattern but I like how Claude Code introduces new features with tips.

```text
✻ Whirring… (esc to interrupt · thinking)
  ⎿ Tip: Start with 'btw' to ask a quick side question
    without interrupting Claude's current work
```

I tried this one out and it didn't feel better than opening another `claude`.
It seems to have the existing conversation context, which is helpful, but the question doesn't seem to be enqueued immediately and waits for the previous prompt to complete, so I don't love that.
My ideal behavior would be to fork the conversation and run the `btw` prompt in parallel.

Someone told me `amp` has threads and maybe those do that.

I did a release of [Tomo](https://www.wvlen.llc/apps/tomo) today for the first time in a while.
Dealt with an annoying scrollbar issue and added conversation exporting which I've wanted for a while.
The exported folder becomes helpful input context to an agent when I use Tomo to do a side task then bring back what I learned into the agent session.

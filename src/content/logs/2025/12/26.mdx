I've been working with Claude Code to build a tool to help me write in this blog.
I've historically used Cursor to write in MDX and Claude Code to help build and wire up custom Astro and sometimes React components to add interactivity to posts.

There are a few rough edges though.
My content scaffolds are Python scripts, which are not quite as fluid as I'd prefer.
My image optimization process is kludgy.
My content importing processes (currently experimenting with [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/)) is still a work in progress.

VS Code and Cursor have brought me a long way, but there really is no substitute to having more control over the tools you use everyday.
If you want something, you can build it.
This is what I am attempting now with `Tarn`.

I used [`amp`](https://ampcode.com) to create a multi-client, single-server real-time websocket application using [Cloudflare Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/).
It went quite well.

I wasn't expecting `amp` to take so many actions on my behalf without permission.
It deployed the site after the first prompt since `wrangler` was already configured on my system.

Cool, but also I don't think I'm ready for that level of full-send, having seen a "Claude Code `rm -rf`'d my home directory" article yesterday.

I enjoyed reading Yuxuan's [article](https://trace.yshui.dev/2024-05-copilot.html) on whether Github Copilot increased their productivity.
I personally don't love Copilot but enjoy using other AI-assisted software tools like Cursor, which allow for use of more capable models than Copilot.
It's encouraging to see more folks adopting a more unfiltered thought journal.

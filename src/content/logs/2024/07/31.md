I tried stacking multiple pages of a pdf vertically as a single image to a model, then doing data extraction from this.
It didn't work.
I imagine this is because models aren't trained on much data like this.
The inference seemed to output made up data.

An [interesting pitch](https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/why-i-prefer-rst-to-markdown/) written by Hillel for preferring reStructuredText to Markdown.

A search with Perplexity seemed to corroborate this assertion.
It led me to [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08189) which used RAG to reduce hallucinations.

Jon wrote about his [computer setup and tools](https://jnsgr.uk/2024/07/how-i-computer-in-2024/).
I always take inspiration from these kinds of write-ups.

I'd like to get something like [open-webui](https://docs.openwebui.com/) set up to run remote or local using the same UI, that I can customize.
Still thinking about what this could look like.

A [great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MDjS9-dNw) by Mark Russinovich about AI security.
He discusses model fingerprinting, backdoors, jailbreaking, model tool abuse, crescendo attacks and more.
Definitely a lot to keep in mind when building with models.

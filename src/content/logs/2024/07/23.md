Tried to join in on the `llama3.1-405b` hype using Groq but sadly, no dice

```sh
curl -X POST https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GROQ_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "llama-3.1-405b-reasoning",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Hello, how are you?"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "The model `llama-3.1-405b-reasoning` does not exist or you do not have access to it.",
    "type": "invalid_request_error",
    "code": "model_not_found"
  }
}
```

The queue to try it out in [their chat](https://groq.com/) is also quite long, so I guess either the infra needs to scale up or the hype needs to die down.

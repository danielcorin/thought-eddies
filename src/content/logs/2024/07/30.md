I wrote and screen-recorded myself building a Python app to call a model to extract structured data from an image, making heavy use of codegen with Cursor.
The same protobuf is used as instructions in the prompt and to unpack the result returned by the model into an instance of the class generated from the protobuf via `protoc`.
I'm planning to open source this pattern once I get it into a better state.
Also, I'm looking into ways to host the video of the screen recording for fun and to reference later.

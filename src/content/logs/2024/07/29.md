This point resonates with me.
The more time I spend prompting models, the more it's becoming clear that the clarity of the instructions are what matter most.
Writing clear, unambiguous instructions is not easy.
Decrease scope and you have a chance of doing it well.

[Protobuf](https://protobuf.dev/) messages/schema in prompt instructions seem to be able to provide similar output structure to Pydantic, as [`instructor`](https://github.com/jxnl/instructor) and other libraries do.
I've experimented with this approach [in the past]({{< ref "/posts/2023/protobuf-contracts-with-llms.md" >}}) but there is a bit more that could be done to structure the messages so that they could serve the dual-purpose of prompt instructions and as RPC schemas.

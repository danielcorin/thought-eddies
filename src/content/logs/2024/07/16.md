Research and experimentation with models presents different problems than I am used to dealing with on a daily basis.
The structure of what you want to try out changes often, so I understand why some folks prefer to use notebooks.
Personally, notebooks haven't caught on for my so I'm still just writing scripts.
Several times now, I've run a relatively lengthy (and expensive) batch of prompts through a model only to realize something about my setup wasn't quite right.
Definitely bringing back memories of [finetuning gpt-3.5-turbo to play Connections]({{< ref "posts/2024/fine-tuning-connections.md" >}}) but I'm learning a lot along the way.

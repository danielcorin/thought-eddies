## espanso

I tried out adding [espanso](https://espanso.org/) to configure text expansions rather than using [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) just to try something new.
This is [the PR](https://github.com/danielcorin/nix-config/pull/3/files) to add it to my Nix configurations.
The existing examples are a toy configuration.
The tool seems to support far more complex configuration that I still need to look into further.

## `gpt-4o-mini`

{{< x user="dadkins_" id="1815048314439532685" >}}

Admittedly, I have not gone to deep yet using `gpt-4o-mini`.
I've been quite happy with `claude-3.5-sonnet` and I typically use the most advanced model I can because I'm not running a huge number of model inferences per day at the moment.
However, swyx's point

> intelligence too cheap to meter, but also too ephemeral to support >5 players doing R&D? is there an angle here i'm missing?

makes a lot of sense to me.

How can several companies continue to spend the current amount of R&D dollars when it's possible for one to fully marginalize almost the entire body of work of the rest with a single model release?
I need to use `gpt-4o-mini` more to understand if that is what's in fact happening.
One interesting thing I learned as I started to try it out -- it seems to think it's trained on the GPT-3.5 architecture.
Does this mean OpenAI back ported other improvement to an old model architecture, data set or training approach?
I'm trying to figure out if there is any concrete information on this.

I think what Danny said (in the first tweet) is interesting but I'm not yet sure what to make of it.

> people frame this like it’s somehow a win over llama, when in fact the goal of llama has wildly succeeded: [sic] commoditize models and drive token cost to zero

It seems like the inevitable ebb and flow of the current dynamic with models.
If like swyx implies, this causes R&D consolidation since the market can't support ~5 major competitors in this space, the token price may go up again with less competition.
Something to revisit.

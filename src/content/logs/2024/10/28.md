I tried training a language model with fastai on Modal.

First I attempted it in a standalone Modal script.
I first wrote a script to unpack the data to a volume, then ran the `fit_one_cycle` function with the learner.
I ran into an issue with `counter.pkl` sort of similar to [this issue](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/issues/2787) but I haven't figured out how to resolve it yet.

On a whim, I checked to see if I could run a Jupyter notebook on Modal.
Apparently, [you can](https://modal.com/docs/guide/notebooks)!

I ran

```sh
modal launch jupyter --gpu a10g
```

then started to mess around a bit.
I uploaded the imdb data again then untarred it.

I was noticing occasionally laggy/busy behavior at times that I wasn't expecting.
This experiment ended for the day when I tried to run

```python
learn = language_model_learner(
    dls_lm, AWD_LSTM, drop_mult=0.3, metrics=[accuracy, Perplexity()]
).to_fp16()
```

I got a `SSLCertVerificationError` and wasn't prepared to spend more time debugging.

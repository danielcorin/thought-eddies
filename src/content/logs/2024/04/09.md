Gemini Pro 1.5 up and running.
I've said this before but I will say it again -- the fact that I don't need to deal with GCP to use Google models gives me joy.

```sh
❯ llm -m gemini-1.5-pro-latest "who is the fastest man in the world?"
As of November 2023, **Usain Bolt** is still considered the fastest man in the world. He holds the world record in the 100 meters with a time of 9.58 seconds, set in 2009.  He also holds the record for the 200 meters at 19.19 seconds, achieved in 2009 as well.
```

Having all these models readily available is great.
My hope is to play around with several to become a bit of an amateur [model sommelier](https://interconnected.org/home/2023/03/22/tuning).

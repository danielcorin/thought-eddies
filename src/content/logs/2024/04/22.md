About a [month ago]({{< ref "logs/2024/03/25.md" >}}), I had been looking into creating a NL to SQL plugin for `datasette`.
Simon release a version of exactly that [the next day](https://github.com/datasette/datasette-query-assistant/commit/146927b62889ab28e19c604d9d3ee8ddb26f3991) and I came across it in his article [here](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Apr/17/ai-for-data-journalism/#ai-assisted-sql).
Hopefully I can find time to try this out in the next few days.

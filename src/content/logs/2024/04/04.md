Today, I learned about Command-R model series from [Cohere](https://cohere.com/) from Shawn's great AI newsletter ([ainews](https://buttondown.email/ainews)).
I searched to see if a plugin was available for `llm` and Simon had literally [authored one](https://github.com/simonw/llm-command-r/) 8(!) hours earlier.
Folks like you keep me inspired and motivated üôè.
No better workflow out there that I know of:

```sh
llm install llm-command-r

llm -m r-plus hello
Error: No key found - add one using 'llm keys set cohere' or set the COHERE_API_KEY environment variable

llm keys set cohere
Enter key: ...

llm -m r-plus "hi, who am I speaking with?"

A new thing I am trying is sending thanks to folks who write articles or build projects that I find useful.
I got a taste of this after writing an [article](/posts/2024/fine-tuning-connections) on fine-tuning gpt-3.5 to solve the Connections word game, even though the results didn't turn out that well.
Getting the positive feedback was quite motivating and my hope is to give others the same appreciation for the positive impact their work makes on me.

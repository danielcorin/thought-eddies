I finally had a chance to use Github Copilot Chat in VS Code.
It has a function to chat inline like Cursor, which has worked quite well given my initial use of it.
I'm looking forward to using this more.
Unfortunately, it's not available for all IDEs yet but hopefully will be soon!

I watched lesson 3 of the [FastAI course](https://course.fast.ai/).
I've really enjoyed Jeremy Howard's lecture's so far.

Hardly seemed with a TIL post because it was too easy, but I learned `gpt-4` is proficient at building working `ffmpeg` commands.
I wrote the prompt

> convert m4a to mp3 with ffmpeg

and it responsed with

```sh
ffmpeg -i input.m4a -codec:v copy -codec:a libmp3lame -q:a 2 output.mp3
```

Since the problem at hand was low stakes, I just ran the command and, to my satisfaction, it worked.
Language models can't solve every problem but they can be absolutely delightful when they work.

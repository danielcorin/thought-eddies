I worked through a basic SwiftUI 2 tutorial to build a simple Mac app.
Swift and SwiftUI are an alternative to accomplish the same things Javascript and React do for web.
I could also use something like [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) to build a cross-platform app using web technology, but after reading [Mihhail's article](https://papereditor.app/dev) about using macOS native technology to develop [Paper](https://papereditor.app/), I was curious to dip my toe in and see what the state of the ecosystem looked like.
He opted to use Objective-C, for performance reasons.
I decided to try Swift because I've written a bit of Objective-C years ago.
I like the ergonomics of Swift as a language well enough.
I can't say I'm a huge fan of Xcode.
My hardware is almost certainly too old, but Xcode is sluggish and not fun to use in a way that the web development tools I use are not (at least on my machine).
Seeing all the things that [PWAs can do today](https://whatpwacando.today/), I'm unsure whether it makes sense to invest in learning SwiftUI unless I want to build native mac apps.

Several interesting releases today/recently.

Multi-modal llama: [llama3.2](https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-3-2-connect-2024-vision-edge-mobile-devices/).
Tons of model infra providers announced availability day one.
We seem to be getting into a bit of a rhythm here.
It's also convenient for Meta who doesn't need to scale the infra (though they of all companies would probably be capable) -- providers do it for them.

[AllenAI's Olmo](https://allenai.org/open-models): another interesting, open source multi-modal model.

Open source is catching up in multi-modal.
I'm looking forward to experimenting with both of these.

I tried installing `llama3.2` with `ollama` but I don't think the latest Nix package version can support the multi-modal architecture.

I updated macOS to Sequoia and Nix broke.
Now I'm dealing with that since most of my system doesn't work üôÅ

---

Not a great feeling to have that not work but I found [this post](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer/issues/753) which mentioned the command

```sh
security find-generic-password -s "Nix Store" -w
```

I used the password from there to unlock the disk and it worked.
Now my dotfiles and things were loading correctly, with the Nix Store unlocked.
Unfortunately, this wasn't all I needed to do.
I had to uninstall Nix and cleanup some files following [these instructions](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer/issues/608#issuecomment-1692499816).

```sh
sudo rm /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.nixos.activate-system.plist
sudo launchctl bootout system/org.nixos.activate-system
/nix/nix-installer uninstall
sudo rm /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

Finally, I re-bootstrapped by `nix-darwin` config with

```sh
nix run nix-darwin -- switch --flake ~/.config/nix/flake.nix
```

and I was back on solid ground.

I tried running nix-darwin again as some point but ran into this issue

```sh
nix run nix-darwin -- switch --flake ~/.config/nix/flake.nix
error: cannot connect to socket at '/nix/var/nix/daemon-socket/socket': Connection refused
```

Loading/restarting the daemons seemed to handle this

```sh
sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.nixos.nix-daemon.plist
sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.nixos.nix-daemon.plist
```

My `ollama` server seems not to be running but that's a problem for another day.

Having used [`fasthtml`](https://fastht.ml/) and sqlite of a couple projects now, I was interested in trying to run an app as a Cloudflare Worker to make use of D1, which is a serverless, sqlite compatible database.
It looks like the library needs to be added to the worker runtime first, according to [this issue](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd/discussions/2488).

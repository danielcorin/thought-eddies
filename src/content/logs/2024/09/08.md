I was going to write a quick guide on how to get up and running using Google's Gemini model via API, since I found it quite straightforward and Twitter is currently dunking on Google for how hard this is.
When I tried to retrace my steps, the CSS for the documentation was failing to load with a 503, so I guess this will have to wait until another day.

Played around a bit with [`baml`](https://github.com/BoundaryML/baml) for extraction structured data with a VLM.
It's an interesting approach and has better ergonomics and tooling from most things I've tried so far.
I like how you can declare test cases in the same place as the object schemas and that there is a built-in playground.
I need to see how to handle multi-step pipelines.

I experimented with doing data extraction from pictures of menus.
Early results were mixed.
I think my photo quality isn't great and that might be one of the bigger issues.

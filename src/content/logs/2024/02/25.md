Github Code Search is an indispensable part of my workflow that I don't think gets mentioned enough.
There are so many great projects out there that solve or may help you solve what you are currently working on.
I was looking to write a shell script to invoke the `caffeinate` command on macOS to keep my system awake.
The default, this tool runs an blocks forever in the terminal while it does its job.
I wanted to manage it in the background.
I thought through the beginnings of how I might do that myself.
Something like

```sh
ps aux | grep caffeinate
# if running, kill pid
# if not running, start
```

I plugged `ps aux | grep caffeinate` into [Code Search](https://github.com/search?type=code&q=ps%20aux%20%7C%20grep%20caffeinate) and found several different approaches for what I had in mind.
A language model does pretty well too.

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# This script toggles the 'caffeinate' command on macOS.

# Check if caffeinate is running
pid=$(pgrep caffeinate)

if [ -z "$pid" ]; then
  # If caffeinate is not running, start it
  caffeinate &
  echo "caffeinate started"
else
  # If caffeinate is running, kill it
  kill $pid
  echo "caffeinate stopped"
fi
```

I suppose the language model wins today, for introducing me to `pgrep`.

I settled on the following because I like one-liners:

```sh
pgrep caffeinate > /dev/null && kill $(pgrep caffeinate) || caffeinate -dim &
```

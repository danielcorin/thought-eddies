Fell down the system customization rabbit hole.
Looking at switching to [Allacrity](https://alacritty.org/) or [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) as a terminal emulator.
Getting [goku](https://github.com/yqrashawn/GokuRakuJoudo) setup as an app and hotkey launcher on top of [Karabiner](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/).
Playing with [yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) as a window manager.
Looking at [sketchybar](https://github.com/FelixKratz/SketchyBar) as a custom status bar.
Trying to manage it all with [nix-darwin](https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin) and [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager).

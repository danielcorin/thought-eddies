Today, was a first day setting up a new computer.
I spent most of the time installing applications and building up my setting with declarative configurations.
This [site](https://macos-defaults.com) has been helpful.
I also started [this walkthrough](https://nixcademy.com/2024/01/15/nix-on-macos/) for setting up nix on a Mac.

I had to temporarily disable my `nix.conf` that was generated from the installer then run

```sh
nix --extra-experimental-features nix-command --extra-experimental-features flakes run nix-darwin -- switch --flake .
```

to run the `flake.nix` file.

I ended up uninstalling `nix-darwin` after there were several issues I encountered following the instructions on a brand new Mac (even though this article was written a month ago).
This beta vibe has continued to be my experience with Nix, though each time I return to it, I feel a get a bit more insight into what is happening and how it can be useful.
Unfortunately, the error messages are also difficult to troubleshoot with search engines or language models.

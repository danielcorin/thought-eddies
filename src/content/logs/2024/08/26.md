I failed many attempts at getting Sonnet to write code to display the folder structure of the output of a `tree -F` command using shortcodes.
After a lot of prompting, I wrote a mini-design doc on how the feature needed to be implemented and used it as context for Sonnet.
I tried several variants of instructions in the design including trying to improve it with the model itself for clarity.
I validated that the model could translate from the `tree -F` to the html markup directly.
It could.
That in fact is the example html target document in my design doc. Here is that doc:

# File Tree Shortcode

This document outlines the requirements for a Hugo shortcode that generates an HTML representation of a file tree structure.

## Input
The shortcode takes a multi-line string input representing the output of a `tree -F` command. For example:

```text
./
├── Makefile
├── __pycache__/
│   ├── clean.cpython-312.pyc
│   ├── ex.cpython-312.pyc
│   ├── ex1.cpython-312.pyc
│   ├── ex2.cpython-312.pyc
│   ├── extract.cpython-312.pyc
│   └── main.cpython-312.pyc
├── ex.py
└── src/
    ├── __pycache__/
    │   ├── clean.cpython-312.pyc
    │   └── extract.cpython-312.pyc
    ├── clean.py
    └── extract.py
```

## Output
The shortcode should generate nested HTML lists representing the file tree structure:

- Folders are represented by `<li>` elements with a `<span class="caret">` child containing the folder name.
- Files are represented by simple `<li>` elements.
- The content of each folder is contained in a `<ul class="nested">` element.
- The root folder ('./' in the example) should be treated as the topmost level.

## Requirements
1. Support arbitrary depth of nested folders.
2. Use tree command characters (├, │, └, ─ and spaces) from the input to determine the level at which the file or folder should be nested.
3. Distinguish between folders (ending with '/') and files.

Assume the input will be well formed.

## Usage

```html
[shortcode begin]
./
├── Makefile
├── __pycache__/
│   ├── clean.cpython-312.pyc
│   ├── ex.cpython-312.pyc
│   ├── ex1.cpython-312.pyc
│   ├── ex2.cpython-312.pyc
│   ├── extract.cpython-312.pyc
│   └── main.cpython-312.pyc
├── ex.py
└── src/
    ├── __pycache__/
    │   ├── clean.cpython-312.pyc
    │   └── extract.cpython-312.pyc
    ├── clean.py
    └── extract.py
[shortcode end]
```

Here is example html markup that shows how the above example of the shortcode should render.

```html
<ul>
    <li><span class="caret">./</span>
        <ul class="nested">
            <li>Makefile</li>
            <li><span class="caret">__pycache__</span>
                <ul class="nested">
                    <li>clean.cpython-312.pyc</li>
                    <li>ex.cpython-312.pyc</li>
                    <li>ex1.cpython-312.pyc</li>
                    <li>ex2.cpython-312.pyc</li>
                    <li>extract.cpython-312.pyc</li>
                    <li>main.cpython-312.pyc</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>ex.py</li>
            <li><span class="caret">src</span>
                <ul class="nested">
                    <li><span class="caret">__pycache__</span>
                        <ul class="nested">
                            <li>clean.cpython-312.pyc</li>
                            <li>extract.cpython-312.pyc</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>clean.py</li>
                    <li>extract.py</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
```

The above tree is depth three since `src` contains a folder called `__pycache__` which contains files.
The shortcode should support file trees of arbitrary depth.
The output should also trim away the markup outputted by the `tree` command and just show the file names.
If it's helpful, you can assume a folder will also end with a `/` in its name.

Here is the output of one such attempt which took several follow to even get it to render.
_It doesn't work_.
I tried for a while and couldn't get Sonnet to complete this task as described.

```html
{{ $tree := .Inner | replaceRE "^\\./" "" | split "\n" }}
<ul>
    {{ range $index, $line := $tree }}
    {{ $indent := (len (replaceRE "[^│]" "" $line)) }}
    {{ $isDir := (strings.HasSuffix $line "/") }}
    {{ $name := (replaceRE "^[│ ]*├── |^[│ ]*└── |^[│ ]*│ |^[│ ]* " "" $line) }}
    {{ if eq $indent 0 }}
    {{ if $isDir }}
    <li><span class="caret">{{ $name }}</span>
        <ul class="nested">
            {{ else }}
            <li>{{ $name }}</li>
            {{ end }}
            {{ else if $isDir }}
            {{ range $i, $v := seq 1 $indent }}
        </ul>
    </li>
    {{ end }}
    <li><span class="caret">{{ $name }}</span>
        <ul class="nested">
            {{ else }}
            {{ range $i, $v := seq 1 (sub $indent 1) }}
        </ul>
    </li>
    {{ end }}
    <li>{{ $name }}</li>
    {{ end }}
    {{ end }}
    {{ range $i, $v := seq 1 (len $tree) }}
</ul>
</li>
{{ end }}
</ul>
```

I also prompted Sonnet on whether it could identify any issues with the described approach, like if I somehow am suggesting it does something impossible (I'm not seeing it).
It said

>  I believe the approach is generally sound and should work well.

Finally, I tried adding some of the [Hugo docs](gohugo.io/templates/introduction/) to Cursor but this didn't seem to be improving things much.
Side note: I need to spend some time experimenting with [Zed](https://zed.dev/).

My takeaway is Sonnet wasn't trained on enough Hugo templates to be good at it.
All the prompt engineering I could throw at it in a few hours didn't seem to be enough to overcome these challenges.
Neither was trying `gpt-4`, `llama-70b` or one of the Gemini models (I forgot which I tried).

The fact that models could not solve this task violated my intuition for the problem.
I was able to prompt the model to write Python code to output the desired html and it did so without issue.

```python
def generate_file_tree_html(tree_output):
    lines = tree_output.strip().split("\n")
    html_output = []
    stack = []

    for line in lines:
        indent_level = len(line) - len(line.lstrip(" │"))
        is_dir = line.strip().endswith("/")
        name = line.strip().split(" ", 1)[-1].strip("│ ├── └── ")

        while stack and stack[-1][0] >= indent_level:
            html_output.append("</ul></li>")
            stack.pop()

        if is_dir:
            html_output.append(
                f'<li><span class="caret">{name}</span><ul class="nested">'
            )
            stack.append((indent_level, name))
        else:
            html_output.append(f"<li>{name}</li>")

    while stack:
        html_output.append("</ul></li>")
        stack.pop()

    return "<ul>" + "".join(html_output) + "</ul>"


# Example usage
tree_output = """
./
├── Makefile
├── __pycache__/
│   ├── clean.cpython-312.pyc
│   ├── ex.cpython-312.pyc
│   ├── ex1.cpython-312.pyc
│   ├── ex2.cpython-312.pyc
│   ├── extract.cpython-312.pyc
│   └── main.cpython-312.pyc
├── ex.py
└── src/
    ├── __pycache__/
    │   ├── clean.cpython-312.pyc
    │   └── extract.cpython-312.pyc
    ├── clean.py
    └── extract.py
"""

html_output = generate_file_tree_html(tree_output)
print(html_output)
```

This script outputs the expected html (without whitespace).

Lastly, I prompted Sonnet to translate this working Python code into a Hugo shortcode.
This approach also failed.
The model kept hallucinating functions like `while` that don't exist in the Hugo templating language.
At this point, I didn't have confidence in any of the models to write Hugo templates/shortcodes.

Before I called it, I figured if I were to try one more thing, I would pull together as many examples of Hugo template docs and usage and pass that as context to the model with the same instructions.
I manually copied and pasted a ton of the examples from https://gohugo.io/functions then prompted the model similarly to before.

It output the following

```html
{{- $tree := .Inner | strings.TrimRight "\n" | split "\n" -}}
{{- $root := index $tree 0 | strings.TrimRight "/" -}}

<ul>
  <li><span class="caret">{{ $root }}</span>
    <ul class="nested">
      {{- $level := 0 -}}
      {{- $stack := slice (dict "level" 0 "ul" "") -}}
      {{- range after 1 $tree -}}
        {{- $line := . -}}
        {{- $name := $line | replaceRE "^[│├└]([─ ]+)" "" | strings.TrimRight "/" -}}
        {{- $depth := len (findRE "[│├└]" $line) -}}
        {{- $isDir := strings.HasSuffix . "/" -}}

        {{- if gt $depth $level -}}
          <ul class="nested">
          {{- $stack = append $stack (dict "level" $depth "ul" "</ul>") -}}
        {{- else if lt $depth $level -}}
          {{- range seq (sub $level $depth) -}}
            {{- $last := index $stack (sub (len $stack) 1) -}}
            {{ $last.ul | safeHTML }}
            {{- $stack = slice $stack 0 (sub (len $stack) 1) -}}
          {{- end -}}
        {{- end -}}

        <li>
          {{- if $isDir -}}
            <span class="caret">{{ $name }}</span>
          {{- else -}}
            {{ $name }}
          {{- end -}}
        </li>

        {{- $level = $depth -}}
      {{- end -}}
      {{- range seq (len $stack) -}}
        {{- $last := index $stack (sub (len $stack) 1) -}}
        {{ $last.ul | safeHTML }}
      {{- end -}}
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
```

which also does not work.
Maybe, I'll get this working at some point.

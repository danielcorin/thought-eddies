I setup [WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/index.html) and experimented a bit.
It's a nice terminal emulator.
I like the builtin themes and Lua as a configuration language.
These days, I largely rely on the Cursor integrated terminal.
It's not the greatest, but having <kbd>cmd+k</kbd> it's a bit of a killer feature.

I watched Jeremy Howard's [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuipZMUch18) with Carson Gross, the author of [`htmx`](https://htmx.org/).
As someone who learned my first bits of web dev with jQuery, I feel like I appreciate the foundations of the approach in the library, but am still early in fully developing my mental model.
Jeremy built a Python wrapper on top of `htmx` called [`fastml`](https://docs.fastht.ml/) and the combination of these technologies is pretty well aligned with the technology I like to work with.

Another library mentioned in the conversation that I am going to check out was [surreal](https://github.com/gnat/surreal) CSS.

OpenAI released [structured outputs](https://openai.com/index/introducing-structured-outputs-in-the-api/) as a first class feature in the API.
It's nice to see this get added but is also a bit annoying as the model APIs, capabilities and SDKs diverge further.

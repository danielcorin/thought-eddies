I did some experimentation deriving a data model iteratively (something I am currently calling "data model distillation") by sequentially passing multiple images (could work with text as well) to a language model and prompting it to improve the schema using any new learnings from the current image.
Results so far have been unimpressive.

I've been hearing good things about `mistral-large-2`.
I'm working on adding it to [`bots-doing-things`](https://github.com/danielcorin/bots-doing-things/) but have had a bit of dependency trouble so far.

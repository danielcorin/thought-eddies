I've been doing some experimentation with smaller models and embeddings, including [`distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english`](https://huggingface.co/distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english) and [`cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest`](https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest) as binary sentiment classifiers and [`google/vit-base-patch16-224`](https://huggingface.co/google/vit-base-patch16-224) as an image classifier.

Also [`GoogleNews-vectors-negative300`](https://github.com/mmihaltz/word2vec-GoogleNews-vectors) and [`fasttext-wiki-news-subwords-300`](https://huggingface.co/fse/fasttext-wiki-news-subwords-300) for embeddings to try and find semantically similar words and concepts.

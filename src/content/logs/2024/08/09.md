I figured out the issue with adding `mistral-large`.
After a bit of debugging, I realized by manually calling [`llm_mistral.refresh_models()`](https://github.com/simonw/llm-mistral/blob/main/llm_mistral.py#L35) that something was wrong with how I had added the secret on Modal.
It turns out the environment variable name for the Mistral API key needed to be `LLM_MISTRAL_KEY`.
I'm going to try and make a PR to the repo to document this behavior.

I've been trying to run models locally.
Mostly specifically [colpali](https://huggingface.co/vidore/colpali) and [florence-2](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Florence-2-large).
This has not been easy.
It's possible these require GPUs and might not be macOS friendly.
I've ended up deep in Github threads and dependency help trying to get basic inference running.
I might need to start with something more simpler and smaller and build up from there.

A taste of the problems

```sh

  note: This error originates from a subprocess, and is likely not a problem with pip.

Not great.

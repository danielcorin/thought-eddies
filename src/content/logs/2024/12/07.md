> I don't know anything about rice disease but apparently these are various rice diseases and this is what they look like.

- [Jeremy Howard, Fast.ai Course Lesson 6](https://youtu.be/AdhG64NF76E?feature=shared&t=3939)
I have no idea if Jeremy had this in mind when he said this (alluding to the fact he doesn't know about the subject area, but when building with ML that doesn't necessarily matter), but this sentiment is how I feel when building with and learning about anything new with language models, at least to start.
I use LLMs to bootstrap my understanding of whatever situation I find myself in, and from there, try to orient myself and gain a better understanding.

It's incredible to be able to learn from whatever your starting point is rather than needing to try and read less relevant introductory material to start to understand an area.
It's akin to having a CSV and wanting to run SQL queries on your data and needing to start by reading the `pandas` or `sqlite` documentation.

Most of the effort is finding what you're looking for to solve the problem in front of you.
LLMs bring this directly to you given your ability to describe what you need.

No other resource is tailored to help you solve problems like this.
It's an order of magnitude better than anything else I have tried with regard to learning and applying existing knowledge.

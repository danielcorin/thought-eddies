Got Delta working on other machines.
It took a lot longer than I expected.
I spent most of the time dealing with build issues regarding:

- missing dependencies
- different paths between dev and production
- loading `vec.dylib` with `sqlite-vec`
- dependencies compiled for the wrong architecture

I tried to write some of this up but it's been challenging to extract and/or remember the specific circumstances and how I solved it in the context of some minimal example.
There are lots of parts that feel a bit wrong or regrettable but were compromises to getting the thing working.

Specifically

- whatever it was I built to get the build working
- using Javascript (not Typescript) for migrations (needed so the migrations could run at runtime in the context of the `main.js`)

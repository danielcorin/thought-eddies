As someone learning to draw, I really enjoyed this article: <https://maggieappleton.com/still-cant-draw>.
I've watched the first three videos in [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1HIh25sbqZnkA1T09UtVHoyjYaMJuK0a) so far and have been sketching random objects from around the house.
I find that I'm not too big of a fan of my drawing as I'm doing it but when I return to it later, I seem to like it more.
Apparently, this is a common experience for creatives.

Added [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/) to my site.
I'm planning to see how I like it compared to [Posthog](https://posthog.com/).

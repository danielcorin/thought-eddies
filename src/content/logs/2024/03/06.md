Today I installed Homebrew.
It's the longest I have ever gone since I learned to code without installing Homebrew on my system.
I've been able to rely on Nix for so much, but it's been time consuming to get everything the way I want it, and I don't want perfect to be the enemy of good.
I can and plan to use `brew` sparingly in the name of reproducibility.

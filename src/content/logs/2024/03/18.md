I use the <kbd>hyper</kbd>+<kbd>u</kbd> keyboard shortcut to open a language model playground for convenience.
I might use this 10-20 times a day.
For the last year or so that I've been doing this, it has always pointed to <https://platform.openai.com/playground>.
As of today, I've switched it to point to <https://console.anthropic.com/workbench?new=1>.
Lately, I've preferred `claude-3-opus` to `gpt-4`.
For a while, I had completely stopped looking for other models as `gpt-4` seemed to be unchallenged, but it's exciting to see new options available.

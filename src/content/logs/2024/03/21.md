Setup a Temporal worker in Ruby and got familiar with its ergonomics.

Tried out this [gpt-4v demo repo](https://github.com/logicalroot/gpt-4v-demos)
Experimented with OCR capabilities of open source multi-modal language models.
Tried `llava:32b` (1.6) and `bakllava` but neither seemed to touch `gpt-4-vison`'s performance.
It was cool to see the former run on a macbook though.

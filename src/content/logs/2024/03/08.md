I tried to get `claude-3-opus` to solve today's Connections.
It did well enough that I am going to try doing this more consistently.

I grew tried of Nix and decided to setup Homebrew as well.
I finally gave in after trying to install [`llm`](https://github.com/simonw/llm) and not being able to figure out how to install plugins despite the message

```text
If you want to install extra llm plugins, use llm.withPlugins([]) expression.
```

In tracing this error, I also learning `nixpkgs` can apply [patches](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/713a54dab13e4eabc983350419795bfaa0a858cd/pkgs/development/python-modules/llm/001-disable-install-uninstall-commands.patch#L21) to libraries in its registry.

I never figured out how to make this work.
Instead, I installed Homebrew which allowed me to install things the standard way

```sh
llm install llm-claude-3
```

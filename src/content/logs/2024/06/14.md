For the first time in a while I used iTunes.
I mean the Music app, sorry.
I clicked on the album art while I was playing a song and the app switch to mini-player mode.
I...didn't see what I could click to get back to the main player.
From my perspective the app had just shrunken down to the mini-player.
I hesitantly clicked the lyrics button.
Yeah, definitely not that.
I clicked the red button of the traffic lights.
Ah.
Has this always been this way?
It's been a while.

I enjoyed reading Jordan's [post](https://notes.jordanscales.com/emails), a walk down memory lane of his career so far through a series of emails.
He includes things like following up on internship opportunities, negotiating, and meeting people who would change the course of his career.
He inspired me to look back through some old emails as well, both to remember this time and acknowledge how much has changed since then.

I managed to find my original offer letter from Uber in 2016, which brought back many memories that I might write about in longer form sometime in the future.

I strongly support Jordan's suggestion about improving your negotiation skills.
Negotiation is something that made me deeply uncomfortable in the past, but I'd like to believe it's an area I've grown in.

I spent some time moving my bookmarks and workflows to Raindrop from Pocket.
I'm mostly done with a short post on how and why I did that.
I'd like to use the [`python-raindropio`](https://github.com/atsuoishimoto/python-raindropio/) package to generate stubs for logs posts from links I bookmark, including comments I write about them.
The Nix flake I use for this blog hampered those efforts.
The `python-raindropio` package isn't available as a Nix package and I'm not particularly well versed in building my own packages with Nix, so that became a bit of a rabbit hole.
After poking around for other available libraries, it turns out, this one isn't even maintained anymore.
It was forked as [`raindrop-io-py`](https://github.com/PBorocz/raindrop-io-py) and it looks like _that_ might not even be maintained anymore.
Not the greatest sign, but the package does still work for the time being.

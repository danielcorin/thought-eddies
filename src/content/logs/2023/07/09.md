I've been playing around more with `nix` lately.
I like what I've seen from it so far: declare dependencies and get an isolated shell with those dependencies.
If distributed, the environment can be trivially recreated on another machine.
So far, it's been a struggle to get a working Python environment with dependencies setup.
I've gotten a lot of cryptic error messages after trying a number of different `flake.nix` files.
I plan to continue to experiment, but thus far the learning curve is tough.

I tried out Llama 2 today using [ollama](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama).
At first pass, it seemed ok a writing Python code but I struggled to get it to effective generate or adhere to specific schema.
I'll have to try a few more things but my initial impressions are mixed (relative to OpenAI models).

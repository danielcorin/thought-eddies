I've been working through a [series on nix-flakes](https://xeiaso.net/blog/series/nix-flakes).
It's well written and shows some interesting applications of the tool set.
I'm still trying to wrap my head around exactly where nix could fit in in my development lifecycle.
It seems like it wraps up builds and package management into one.
Sort of like docker, bazel, pip/npm/brew all in one.
The tutorial has shown some useful variations and has convinced me flakes is the way to go, but I need to spend some more time better understanding the primitives as well.
I understand little of what's going on in the `flake.nix` files I've looked at.

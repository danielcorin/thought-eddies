I've been looking into `hidutil` to potentially replace Karabiner for overriding my capslock behavior.
My first attempt, follow instructions similar to [this post](https://www.naseer.dev/post/hidutil/), was close but unsuccessful.
I was able to remap the capslock key, but it wasn't trigger the key combo I had hoped for -- I use <kbd>cmd</kbd>+<kbd>option</kbd>+<kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>.
Caplock wasn't performing it's normal function and the key light wasn't turning on but it also wasn't triggering my hotkeys.
Hopefully I will have something workable after a bit more time with this.

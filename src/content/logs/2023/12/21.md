I looked into [`11ty`](https://www.11ty.dev/) today to see if it could be worth migrating away from [`hugo`](https://gohugo.io/), which is how (at the time of this post) I build my blog.
After a bit of research and browsing, I setup [this](https://github.com/kohrongying/11ty-blog-starter) template and copied over some posts.
Some over my older posts were using [Hugo's markup for syntax highlighting](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/).
I converted these to standard markdown code fences (which was worthwhile regardless).
I also needed to adjust linking between posts.
In Hugo, I use [`ref`](https://hugo-docs.netlify.app/en/functions/ref/).
In 11ty, these need to be relative links, e.g. `/posts/2023/future-of-personal-knowledge`.
In Hugo, this approach works as well, so I may move to it.

After getting an initial build working, I took stock of my progress and where I aimed to end up.
11ty feels more easily configurable than Hugo.
I prefer the template language ([Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/)) used by the 11ty template I chose over what Hugo uses.
However, I was still many hours away from getting to a spot I was happy with and decided to stop.
I might consider 11ty again when starting something new, but right now, a full migration doesn't seem worth it.

I would _love_ if OpenAI added support for presetting a `max_tokens` url parameter in the Playground.
Something as simple as this:

```text
https://platform.openai.com/playground?mode=chat&model=gpt-4-1106-preview&max_tokens=1024
```

My most common workflow (mistake):

- Press my hotkey to open the playground
- Type in a prompt
- Submit with <kbd>cmd</kbd>+<kbd>enter</kbd>
- Cancel the request
- Increase the "Maximum Length" to something that won't get truncated
- Submit the request again

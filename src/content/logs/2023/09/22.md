I had a bunch of fun following along with [this post](https://randomgeekery.org/post/2020/05/querying-hugo-content-with-python/) with my own Hugo blog to construct a sqlite database of metadata.
Building the database indices, I found a mistake I had made years ago in defining a post's alias, which was a duplicate, so I fixed that.
I've read a lot of praise of sqlite lately and wanted to get more familiar with the tools and ecosystem and this was a nice way to start to do that.

Logan says any changes to the model would have been communicated.
It seems some folks have data that show the model's degradation.
As competition emerges in the space, it could be a problem for OpenAI if they lose user trust on model versioning and evolution.

Tried to setup [Falcon 40B](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-40b).
Used their provided example code and download about 90GB of weights.
Ran the Python code and it failed.
Did a search on the error.
Found many others were seeing the same in the HuggingFace forum.
Eventually, got the program to run in some form.
Maxed out Macbook's memory at about 90GB (went to swap) and crashed the process.
I wonder if a Mac can be tuned to make this work.

I've been following [Jason's](https://twitter.com/jxnlco) working experimenting with different abstractions for constructing prompts and structuring responses.
I've long felt that building prompts with strings is not the type of developer experience that will win the day.
On the other hand, I'm weary of the wrong abstraction that would move the developer too far away from the actual prompt, which would make it harder to construct good prompts and steer the model.
I'm not sure if this is an ORM vs. SQL conversation or if there's an abstraction that exist as a happy medium.

[Richard WM Jones](https://rwmj.wordpress.com/2023/06/14/i-booted-linux-292612-times/) booted Linux 292,612 to find a bug where it hangs on boot.
I loved reading the recounting of his process to accomplish this, by bisecting through the different versions of Linux and boot each thousands of times to determine whether the version contained the bug.

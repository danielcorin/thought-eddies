I've been trying to find a simple way to host a website that formats and serves a nice looking version of a recipe written in markdown.
There are a few open source projects available, but nothing that has fit the bill yet.
I briefly had the idea to try out something with Next.js and `mdx` but I found when I scaffolded a new app that I didn't even recognize the project structure.
Next.js has moved to the "[App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app)" approach for structuring projects.
It's not immediately obvious or intuitive how this works.
As a batteries-included framework, it makes sense that different approaches to structure will have their own learning curves.
Nevertheless, it's a bit irritating how frequently this structure changes.
I have a ~2-3 year old Next.js project that looks nothing like the project I am currently working on.
And the project I am currently working on looks very different from a newly scaffolded project with App Router today.

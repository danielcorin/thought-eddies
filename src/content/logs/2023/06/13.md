I was listening to a [podcast interview](https://fs.blog/knowledge-project-podcast/adam-robinson-2/) of Adam Robinson and he was discussing why he believed it is important process information with your body.
He gives the example that when listening to something, he stops around once every minute and sees how it feels.
He later goes on to highlight the importance of recognizing when something is "weird" and paying attention to it, or trusting one's intuition even if rationally we can't understand why something feels unusual.
He asserts that we should take action on these intuitions -- "if something seems a little bit off, it's very off".
I could see this approach contributing to more well-rounded cognition, since it can be easier to discard these "intuitions" as unsubstantiated or lacking facts to justify them.
On the other hand, unless you track how often you intuition proves correct, it could be hard to know if it's well calibrated or trustworthy in the area in which you are applying it.

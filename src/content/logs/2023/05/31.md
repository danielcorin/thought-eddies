A number of folks are reporting gpt-4 appears to be performing less impressively as of late ([additional conversation](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36134249)).
I was using gpt-4 to write code earlier today, and anecdotally, can say it seems to be less effective at code generation.
It still writes working code but the code, but the tests cases it provided aren't always correct and it seems to be less "expert level" than I recall initially.

I've been following Eric's posts about SudoLang since the [first installment](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/sudolang-a-powerful-pseudocode-programming-language-for-llms-d64d42aa719b) back in March.
I've skimmed through the [spec](https://github.com/paralleldrive/sudolang-llm-support/blob/main/sudolang.sudo.md) and the value proposition quite compelling.
SudoLang seeks to allow programmers all levels to instruct LLMs and can also be transpiled into your programming language of choice.
While I'm still early in my understanding of how to use this technique, it's one I'm following closely and continuing to experiment with.

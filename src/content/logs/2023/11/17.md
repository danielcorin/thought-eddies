I'm betting OpenAI will soon have a Cloud Storage product like Google Drive or iCloud for ChatGPT Plus users.
Having your personal data available in the context of a language model is a massive value add.
With a product like, OpenAI can fully support use cases like "summarize my notes for the week" or "create action item reminders from this recording".
They're already dipped their toe in the water with the Files API.
I expect a more feature complete offering is on the way.

Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Dan Corin.

I work as a software and AI engineer.

For me, being an AI engineer means I'm

- using language model-based agents to build software
- applying language models in software I build and writing evals to measure their reliability
- experimenting with novel UI/UX empowered by language models
- learning classical machine learning foundations and approaches

This site is a sort of digital garden ðŸŒ± for experimentation and with a particular focus on UI/UX for language models.

After writing my [2024 year in review](/posts/2024/2024-year-in-review/#redesignrebuild-this-blog), I realized I wanted another space with more of a personal touch and on focus ease of sharing prose, code and interactive elements.

Thus, [**Thought Eddies**](/) was born.

At my first engineering job, I was introduced to the idea of social capital in
the context of how to ask for help from other engineers and the consequences of
spending one's social capital ineffectively. I don't love the textbook
definitions of social capital but I think the following example is a good
illustration.

When you contribute positively to a social group by respecting shared norms,
shared values, trust, cooperation, and reciprocity, you cultivate your social
capital. When you violate these norms and values, you squander or exhaust that
capital. Misusing social capital can lead you to lose trust of the group.

Since moving on from this role, I've never heard the topic mentioned explicitly
in the same way in a workplace again but I think it's one of the more important
things you can learn as an engineer. The concept of social capital has become
central to how I aim to operate as a positive individual contributor within a
broader engineering organization (though much of this applies for any group of
people).

As an engineer, you consistently encounter unfamiliar things that you need to
learn to do your job effectively. If you're lucky, there may be good
documentation or existing examples, but eventually you'll come across something
you can't quickly figure out or understand.

There are several paths forward in this situation. You could start reading code
until you reach a deep understanding of what is happening. Under time
constraints, this approach could be too time consuming. You may need to ask
someone with more experience for help with your specific issue.

When you ask for help, it's important to demonstrate you value the time of the
person you are asking. My aim is to display I've made a good faith effort to
solve the issue myself and exhausted the resources I was able to find. It's
likely the person who ends up helping me will have their own responsibilities
that my question pulls them away from. I aim to do the following:

- make it easy for them to help me or answer my question
- display my current level of understanding of what I am working on
- avoid wasting their time, by bringing everything I think is relevant to the
  beginning of the conversation (see [No Hello](https://www.nohello.com/))

This approach helps the responder use language that I understand (since I've
shown my level of understanding with my question). It also can reveal areas
where my understanding is flawed that can be corrected, which is exactly the
kind of help I need.

If you're posting a message in a community channel, you may not even know who
that person is when you're articulating your question. My approach in this
situation is to concisely request for help with the following structure:

- a brief introduction of who I am
- what I am trying to accomplish
- what I have attempted so far and what the results have been, including errors

If I have lengthy explanations or examples, I will either try and link out to
them or prepare the entire message first then write a short message to start and
post a longer follow up message in a thread to avoid taking over the entire
conversation of a channel. In addition to valuing the time of the person
answering your question, you want to value the time of your peers who may have
questions and ongoing conversations of their own. Recognize that you're not the
only person trying to get your job done and do your best not to monopolize
conversations.

## Examples

The above might be more theoretical than you're comfortable with. If that's the
case, here are some examples of what I would deem to be good and bad ways to
build social capital rather than squander it.

### Good

> Hi, I'm Dan from the Risk team. My team is working on onboarding to the new
> Streaming Platform. From the [documentation](https://example.com), I
> understand that I need to create a new Kafka topic for each of my services
> that currently calls the RPC in `$old_service`. Is it possible to create
> these topics in bulk? I need to create topics for 10 services, but the
> instructions only seem to support onboarding a single topic at a time. Thanks!

### Why?

The person reading this can understand what you are trying to do and what you
have tried so far. If there is documentation you missed, they'll likely happily
link it and might even recognize it's not as discoverable as it might be since
you clearly made an effort to find it but couldn't. I would expect a positive
interaction to result from this starting message.

### Bad

> How can I bulk onboard topics?

### Why?

It's ambiguous what you are talking about, so the person providing help may need
to ask follow up questions to figure out what you are trying to accomplish.
Follow-ups for clarity are inevitable sometimes but this attempt has made a poor
attempt at clarity. You've not explained what you've tried if anything, so the
person responding will need to ask something like "have you checked the docs?".
They could link you to docs directly. They could assume you already know where
the docs are and suggest you read them. They could need to go search for the
docs themselves to then link to you. Generally, this cursory approach displays
disregard for the time of the person you are hoping will help you. I aim to
display respect for this individual's time, energy and effort because I need
their help to be successful.

## When it goes wrong

At their worst, these types of conversation first require you to establish
common understanding through follow-up questions. In a chat-based environment
where it can be easy to get pulled away from one conversation into another or a
meeting, these lengthier exchanges become increasingly difficult to manage and
can often trail off and require reminder pings from both sides to answer the
last request. In my experience, the longer a conversation goes on, the more
complicated it typically becomes and the less likely all participants are on the
same page. Sometimes a long conversation is needed, but if one is, all the
better if you establish as much context up front. It makes it more likely you'll
get the useful information you are looking for before the conversation trails
off.

## Your reputation

I've been on both sides of asking and being asked for help. I value it
tremendously when someone asks a question with preparation. Unfortunately, those
who ask the least prepared questions are often the most memorable and
frustrating. As the individual providing help, you come to recognize regulars.
With a finite amount of time and energy, you may need to prioritize some asks
over others. In these situations, I prioritize people who use their social
capital effectively because I appreciate their efforts to value my time and do
my best to reciprocate.

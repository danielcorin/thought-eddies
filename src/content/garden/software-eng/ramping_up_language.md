## Koans

Whenever I start a project in a programming language with which I'm not familiar, I try and find "koans" to do in the language along with my daily work.
I'll spend maybe an hour a day working on these until I complete them (assuming I'm liking the exercises and structure).
I think I worked edgecase's [`ruby_koans`](https://github.com/edgecase/ruby_koans) when I first learned Ruby back when I joined Chime.
I found it by searching for "ruby koans".
I couldn't remember if it was this repo at first but then I recalled the "path to enlightenment" metaphor.
I personally found Ruby a very unapproachable language for how much "magic" there is -- it just doesn't resonate with me -- but these exercises made me someone who can write (and read) Ruby.
You can find Koans in many languages easily with a search for "{language} koans".

## Exercism

I used [Exercism](https://exercism.org/) _a bit_.
I liked it and was a fan of the experience but the exercises could be a touch too technically involved for me.
I generally learn a language better on easy exercises and then separately learn how to apply the language in project work with it.
Doing both at once slows down my high-level fluency because I don't see enough language constructs as quickly as I need to to get familiarity.

## My criteria for note taking

- Fast idea capture
- Flexible organization system that requires low maintenance or thought about where content should live
- Good search
- Plaintext

## My current setup

I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) because everything is Markdown.
It has a plugin ecosystem, but I find many of these difficult to work with and time consuming to configure.
I use [Omnisearch](https://github.com/scambier/obsidian-omnisearch) for searching notes.
I use an iOS shortcut to call the [lumberjack](https://github.com/ryanjamurphy/lumberjack-obsidian) plugin to quickly create new notes to capture an idea to be dealt with later.
I use the [PARA method](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/) to organize my content, with an additional of an Inbox.
My top level folders are

```
00 Inbox
10 Projects
20 Areas
30 Resources
40 Archive
```

I mostly like this because it minimizes the time I spend organizing and has a builtin structure for cleanup.
I am reasonably happy with this setup, but I find I don't benefit much from the time I spend improving it.
It seems to be good enough for now.

## Workflows

- Capture an idea on mobile, quickly using a shortcut app icon
- Create notes on Desktop with Obsidian
- Search notes on Desktop, mapped to <kbd>hyper</kbd>+<kbd>space</kbd>
- Edit blog drafts on mobile, synced via my Desktop using `unison` from a local git repo

## Current complaints

- The Obsidian mobile app is slow to load
- Omnisearch occasionally seems to miss some matching files -- maybe an issue with its index
- Sometimes, I fall behind moving things out of Inbox, but I prefer this to dealing with the overhead of classifying something when I just want to write an idea

## Desired improvements

- Solve the complaints
- A better blog post creation and editing processes for mobile, that doesn't require sync between the git repo and Obsidian vault

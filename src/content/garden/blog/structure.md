My blog has the following sections:

## Search

[`/search`](/search)

Search functionality across all the content on this site.

## Posts

[`/posts`](/posts)

I view these as complete or polished pieces. They are of varied quality, but
most have been edited by me several times over and occasionally by a few others.

## TILs

[`/til`](/til) (short for "Today I Learned")

I've seen several other folks write these types of posts. I sort of view them as
notebooks. I write ideas and things I learn in them, but they're only a medium
level of refinement at most, and some are just simple, straightforward things.
They usually have a medium amount of editing but quality varies.

## Logs

[`/logs`](/logs)

Logs are short notes, thoughts, links, and occasionally tweets. They mostly
capture a few moments in a day. These are thoughts that lead to me writing in
the other sections but are generally unrefined and unedited.

## About

[`/about`](/about)

Brief and general, high level things about myself.

## Projects

[`/projects`](/projects)

These are specific attempts to build things over the years. Quality varies a
great deal but they are the product of ideas I had or things I wanted to try.

## Garden

[`/garden`](/garden)

A place for thoughts, ideas and essays I tend to.

## Uses

[`/uses`](/uses)

The software and hardware I use.

## Now

[`/now`](/now)

What I am up to "lately".

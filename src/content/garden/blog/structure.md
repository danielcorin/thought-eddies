## Posts

I view these as complete or polished pieces.
They are of varied quality, but most have been edited by me several times over and occasionally by a few others.

## TILs

[`/til`](/til) (short for "Today I Learned")

I've seen several other folks write these types of posts.
I sort of view them as notebooks.
I write ideas and things I learn in them, but they're only a medium level of refinement at most, and some are just simple. straightforward things.
They usually have a medium amount of editing but quality varies.

## Logs

Logs are short notes, thoughts, links, and occasionally tweets.
They capture fleeting thoughts from the day.
Sometimes, they lead to writing in other sections but are generally unrefined, unedited, incomplete, and sometimes wrong.

Why I have "edit" links on my site:

I use my site's [search page](/search) as a public second brain in certain ways.
When I write something up as a [TIL](/til) it was probably useful enough to be something I'll come back to again.
Because of this, occasionally I have updates or notice changes that need to be made to a particular page.
When I realize this, it is almost always the best time to make the change.
The fastest way to do that is to make a quick file edit in GitHub, a tool with a reasonable experience for quick and minor changes.
It opens in the app on my phone and as a logged-in session on my computer.
I make the edit, commit, the build runs and it's live.
If _you_ click it, it will bring you to a page to create a PR to the site.
If you're making a correction, thank you! It's an honor to have you as a reader.
I hope you've gotten something positive out of my work or that it saved you time.

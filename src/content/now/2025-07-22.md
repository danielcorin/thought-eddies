I just migrated this site from [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to [Astro](https://astro.build/).

I am currently building, exploring, and learning about:

- a macOS native, ambient LLM chat app called [Tomo](https://www.wvlen.llc/apps/tomo)
- running multiple agents at once on the same repo with [Git worktrees](/til/git/worktree)

I recently open sourced [Delta](https://github.com/danielcorin/delta), a tool for branching conversations with LLMs.

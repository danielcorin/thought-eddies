_What is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about)?_

I just migrated this site from Hugo to Astro.

I am currently building, exploring, and learning about:

- a macOS native, ambient LLM chat app called [Tomo](https://www.wvlen.llc/apps/tomo)
- non-chat UXs for interacting with language models
- running multiple agents at once on the same repo with [Git worktrees](/til/git/worktree)

I recently open sourced [Delta](https://github.com/danielcorin/delta), a tool for branching conversations with LLMs.

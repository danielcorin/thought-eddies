I am currently building, exploring, and learning about:

- a macOS native, ambient LLM chat app called Tomo
- non-chat UXs for interacting with language models
- running multiple agents at once on the same repo with Git worktrees

I recently open sourced [Delta](https://github.com/danielcorin/delta), a tool for branching conversations with LLMs.

I also write interactive articles on [Thought Eddies](https://www.thoughteddies.com/).

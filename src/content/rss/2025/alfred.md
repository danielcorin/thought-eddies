I've mentioned my use of Alfred over on [/uses](/uses), but I just noticed one unusual use of it that I don't think I could have even listed if someone asked me how I use Alfred and why I like it.

I use Alfred as a text editor to quickly modify and chop up text.

The workflow is usually something like <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>space</kbd> to bring up Alfred, <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd> to paste my clipboard, make some edits, and then <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>a</kbd>, <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> to copy the text.
This reads as complicated, but there's almost nothing faster to conjure on my machine than the Alfred window.

I usually just do this without thinking.
Yet somehow, I've never been able to learn vim ðŸ™ƒ.

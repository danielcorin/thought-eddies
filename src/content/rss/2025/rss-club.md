This is an RSS-only post, an idea I thought I came up with but eventually realized has many existing implementations.
This post isn't linked anywhere on my site or in the sitemap.
However, you're probably seeing it because you're reading my RSS feed.
It does [exist](/rss/2025/rss-club) on the site as well though.

As I personally move toward self-curated content and away from algorithm feeds, I'm hoping to connect with more folks who have been doing the same.
If this is something you do or are interested in, feel free to [reach out](mailto:dcorin6@gmail.com)!
I'd love to learn more about what you're doing and why.

I also maintain a [blog roll](/feeds/curated/) of sorts.
Occasionally, I'll include more traditional news articles and Youtube videos in addition to blogs.
It's sort of a breadcrumb trail for myself, a spot to collect links that I frequently end up recommending to friends, and recognizes work I found valuable to my own exploration and learning.

## Another thing

I use Oxford commas now.
For a long time I didn't for a reason I can't remember anymore.
It always felt a little wrong _not_ to use them but I ignored that dissonance for the sake of consistency I suppose.

Since seeing several written examples where a lack of an Oxford comma creates an ambiguous sentence, I decided I'd adopt using them.
Between spending a lot of time prompting LLMs, then coming up with analogies to explain how and why I think they are useful, I've become more interested with techniques that can help with clear communication.

This change seems philosophically in line with a similar change I made more than a decade ago to start crossing my `z`s and `7`s to make them easier to identify when doing handwritten math for physics courses.

After several weeks of daily use, I found myself yearning for a <kbd>cmd</kbd>+<kbd>f</kbd> search feature.
This particular feature is the main one that keeps me loyal to [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/).

In implementing this, I developed a true appreciation for why many terminal apps avoid implementing this feature.
To complicate things further, I needed to switch from the rendered markdown to the raw markdown, since text matches occurred in the raw markdown, so that needed to be visible for match highlighting.

I also had to experiment with many different approaches for cycling through matches to ensure the highlighted match was always visible.

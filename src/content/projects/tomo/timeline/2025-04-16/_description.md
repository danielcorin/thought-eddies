Early development was pretty fast and furious.
Within the first day, I had an MVP working, primarily building with Cursor and Claude 3.7 Sonnet.
While the UI lacked polish, the core design concept has endured.

You'll notice faded colors in the screenshot because early on I made the window partially transparent.
I've since moved away from that though I preserved the feature in the UI settings.

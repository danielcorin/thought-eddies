A friend graciously demoed the app and gave me a ton of feedback.
One piece of this was that it was unintuitive for the app not to have the traffic light buttons by default.
I typically would close the window with <kbd>cmd</kbd>+<kbd>w</kbd> and then open it again with <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>option</kbd>+<kbd>space</kbd>.

I added support for these and also added a UI configuration option to hide the traffic light buttons, since that was my preferred UI.
This was pretty tough to implement just right but I think it makes the app accessible to more people.

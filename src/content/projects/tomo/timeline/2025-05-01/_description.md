With a first pass of markdown rendering working, I continued to polish the UI and get code blocks working in the markdown rendering.

Compared to the UI today, the input message box still didn't have the padding I eventually added, the width of the contents of the codeblock needed to be fixed, and the scrollbar was still always visible.

A lot of parts were in place at this point.
If you've used Tomo, this probably looks pretty familiar (it was still called Atmos at this point).

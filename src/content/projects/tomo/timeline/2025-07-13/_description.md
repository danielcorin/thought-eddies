As a bonus, here's a feature I played around with but never shipped.

I found that sometimes I was working in multiple windows and wanted the LLM to take a look at what I was doing across multiple apps and help me from there.
I played around with `@` referencing an app, which would automatically add screenshots of all windows to Tomo.
If I deleted the `@` reference, the screenshots would be removed.

It never quite felt right so I never shipped it.

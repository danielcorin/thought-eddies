With a nice provider configuration, the next step was to make model selection as easy as possible.
I added a model selector bound to the <kbd>cmd</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> hotkey that allowed for snappy model switching across providers.
With this in place, quickly using any model from anywhere on my system became a breeze.

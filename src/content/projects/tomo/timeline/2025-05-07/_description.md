Things were starting to come together and I was pushing to get a build out to share with friends.
Having never published an app before, I was unfamiliar with the Apple Developer Program and the process of getting an app notarized so it wouldn't automatically be quarantined.

I used Tomo to learn about the errors I was running into and eventually navigate the process of getting an account setup and the app notarized in Xcode.
_So much_ of this process was me sending screenshots to an LLM in Tomo and saying "what now?".
It felt like it carried me through a lot of the process.

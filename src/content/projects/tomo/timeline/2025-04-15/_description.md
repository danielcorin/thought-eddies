This was a screenshot of the absolute first build of the project.
At the time it was called "Atmos" because the idea was that it would exist in the atmosphere of the OS rather than always in the foreground.

The app's concept has largely remained the same since the beginning: a lightweight window you can summon as needed for quick LLM chat/inference.

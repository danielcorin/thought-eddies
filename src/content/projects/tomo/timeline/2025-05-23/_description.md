As I continued using Tomo, I found myself wanting to switch fluidly between providers and across different models within a provider.
I might use `gpt-4.1` for a complex task and then switch to `gpt-4o-mini` to extract all the names from a long passage of text and put them in a bulleted list.

It quickly became tiresome to switch providers with the previous UI and managing the API keys outside the app was a pain.
I added this provider selector UI so that multiple providers could be configured and easily switched between in the settings.

I initially had a vision that when a screenshot was captured with a hotkey, edit controls would appear that would allow you to annotate and crop the screenshot.
I spent a full session working on this concept, but it never felt right.
The red circles on the images are additions to the images from that feature.

I abandoned it for capturing either a window, screen, or area of the screen.

You'll notice the assistant response is always the same.
I had not yet wired up the actual LLM inference API.

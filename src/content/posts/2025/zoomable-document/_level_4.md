## An Interactive Writing Experiment

This project explores dynamic content presentation, combining traditional writing with modern web technologies. Using AI-assisted development, it demonstrates how documents can provide multiple levels of detail, similar to digital maps.

The implementation uses Astro and MDX to create an interactive reading experience that challenges conventional document navigation approaches.

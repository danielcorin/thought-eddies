## Code and Content Convergence

This post explores the intersection of writing and building, sparked by the observation that "code has become content". Modern AI tools have made it possible to prototype ideas more freely, leading to this experiment in interactive content.

## Technical Implementation

Built using Astro and MDX, this project demonstrates how interactive components can be seamlessly integrated with written content. The structure allows for dynamic content presentation while maintaining the flexibility of markdown.

## Content Structure

Traditional content hierarchies include headers, main body content, and supplementary materials. While useful, these structures are static. By incorporating LLMs, we can create dynamic navigation experiences similar to digital maps, allowing readers to zoom between different levels of detail.

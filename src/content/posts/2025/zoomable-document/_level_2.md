## From Code to Content and Back Again

I'm experimenting with an unusual approach to this post, inspired by a conversation between Nabeel Hyatt and Dan Shipper about how "code has become content". This resonates deeply with my recent experience - writing and building have become intertwined, with prose becoming prompts for implementation and vice versa.

Modern LLMs have become incredible idea synthesizers. Their code generation abilities have transformed my creative process - ideas that previously felt too daunting to prototype are now within reach. I'm leveraging this capability to build this interactive post as I write it.

## The Technical Foundation

I'm writing this in an Astro project, specifically in an MDX file that will live in my content directory. The project structure allows me to embed interactive React components directly in my content, creating a seamless blend of prose and functionality.

## Content Hierarchy Deep Dive

Content typically exists in multiple layers:
1. Headings and section markers (`#` in markdown)
2. Main body content (prose, lists, code, images)
3. Supporting elements (asides, footnotes, citations)

Traditional navigation tools like tables of contents leverage these layers, but they're just scratching the surface. With LLMs, we can generate dynamic summaries that provide flexible levels of detail - similar to how Google Maps lets you zoom between street view and satellite view.

## The Map Metaphor

Just as maps show different details at different zoom levels - from individual buildings to entire states - documents could adapt their content density based on the reader's desired perspective. Current prose navigation is mostly static, but what if we could make it as dynamic as digital cartography?

  This is post is from two iterations of my blog ago but I'm keeping it here for posterity.
  After I wrote this, I switched to Hugo.
  I'm currently running this site on Astro.

Hello and welcome to my third and final attempt to start a blog. To be honest, the hardest part has been choosing what tool to use to build and maintain the blog itself. I've been so inundated with The Next Big Thingâ„¢ in [static][Metalsmith] [site][Octopress] [generators][StaticGen] that I never actually got started on the writing part. That didn't seem right.

I've tried to keep things as simple as possible. This is stock [Jekyll][Jekyll] with no bells or whistles to get things started on the right foot. Now all I need to do is make something interesting happen.

In 2022, I had recently started a new job as a software engineer.
As usual, there were a lot of new things to learn and one of those was getting comfortable working in a programming language that I hadn't used professionally before.

My process with getting familiar with a new language at that time was pretty consistent.
Find a good text on it, find a koans repo to work, and start reading and experimenting with existing codebases.
The combination of all of these helped me build a mental model and muscle memory for the language's patterns, the codebase structure, and thinking pathways for reasoning about the system to debug or change it.
This process typically took place over a few months, at least.

## New parts of my process

I don't follow this process anymore.
When I encounter a new repository or language, I start exploring the code with a coding agent.
I prompt the agent with questions and have it generate artifacts walking me through the parts of the system that demonstrate how the system works.
Then I trace through the code myself following these artifacts as a map.
They're not always right, but they're a useful jump off point.
They're also incredibly malleable and composable.

Say I need to add a new Kafka consumer to a system.
I can use the coding agent to research how Kafka integration currently works.
I can then verify that the explanation is grounded in the actual codebase.
Then using that same research, I can draft a plan to make modifications, grounded in the research, which I've validated.
Finally, I can use the agent to implement the plan, which I will review.

This is a distinctly different way of building software systems.
It may not be the way you like to build software, but it's a vast improvement for me.
I am still personally responsible for the code changes I propose.
I'm responsible for following the codebase's conventions and patterns.
I'm responsible for respecting the time of the person who is reviewing my changes.

The responsibility hasn't changed.
What has changed is how I get to the understanding.

## How my thinking has changed

When I'm exploring a codebase with an agent, I'm asking questions about the codebase and the agent is leading me to places where the answers are.
It's creating a sort of map and then I'm following the directions, to see if they actually lead me where they claim.

When I was learning languages via koans, I was practicing the muscle memory necessary to reconstruct the syntax of the language by typing.
I had to translate ideas into code, and translating them into code requires knowledge of the syntax of code.
With a coding agent, I only need to translate my ideas into words.
Maybe the idea's implementation is grounded in specific parts of the system that I have to reference by name, but I don't have to reference them by syntax ever if I don't want to.

Three years ago I would have said "understanding code" would mean that I've traced it from top to bottom.
I know how data flows through the layers of the codebase, from RPC to landing in the database.
These days I think I would define understanding similarly, but what's changed is my confidence in my ability to rapidly identify the paths.

Even in unfamiliar syntaxes, I've generally found that the maps that a coding agent can build allow me to ground myself rapidly in an unfamiliar system and even in an unfamiliar language.
Now I worry less about whether I understand code before I have to start working in it because I can reliably have it explained to me in the context I care about when I encounter it.
The maps and understanding can be just in time, specifically for the problem I'm trying to solve.

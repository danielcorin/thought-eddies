title: 'Thought Eddies'

Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Dan Corin.

I work as a software and AI engineer.

The jury is still out on what an AI engineer is, but for me it means I'm

- applying language models
- writing evals for model applications to ensure their reliability
- experimenting with novel UI/UX empowered by language models
- using language models daily to refine my understanding and perspective on how to use them effectively and productivity
- learning classical machine learning foundations and approaches

This site is a sort of digital garden ðŸŒ± for experimentation and with a particular focus on UI/UX for language models.

I also maintain a written [digital garden](https://www.danielcorin.com/garden/) on [my blog](https://github.com/danielcorin/blog) which I build with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

After writing my [2024 year in review](https://www.danielcorin.com/posts/2024/2024-year-in-review/#redesignrebuild-this-blog), I realized I wanted another space with more of a personal touch and on focus ease of sharing prose, code and interactive elements.

Thus, [**Thought Eddies**](/) was born.
